        Hi, I am Rajan Yadav pursuing my Bachelors in Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunication from Army Institute
        of Technology.
        Considering me a keen react enthusiast<br> who finds thrill in frontend development shall be a good
        judgement. I take on projects, cast them to the precise way, then adore it through UI/UX and the result is a
        blend of fiery codes with soulful design giving life to a wholesome different dimension. 
        <br>
        Movies always bring out the sceptical reviewer in me who clarifies his concepts through own podcasts that I create for the all to some
        extent. Certain things fascinate me and the more random it is the more deeper I tend to dive in it and then
        present all to you through blogs. The developer in me pushes me towards being an open source enthusiast.

    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; text-align: center; max-width: 40em;">
        I have used Jekyll to generate this site, bootstrap and sass for styling and I have used a few plugins
        to make this site work.
        The website source is hosted on Github and the site itself is deployed in cloudflare.
